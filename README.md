# Grading Automation System

An internal **automated grading and code evaluation platform** built to assess student programming submissions at scale using GitHub repositories.

The system replaces manual grading workflows with a consistent, scalable, and configuration-driven evaluation process, while providing real-time visibility into student performance across cohorts and lectures.

---

## Purpose

This platform was designed to solve common challenges in technical education and training environments:

- Manual grading that does not scale  
- Inconsistent evaluation criteria  
- Difficulty tracking progress across multiple cohorts  
- Lack of centralized grading results and analytics  

The Grading Automation System serves as a **single source of truth** for grading outcomes and student status.

---

## What the System Does

- Automatically evaluates student GitHub repositories  
- Applies lecture-specific grading rules  
- Tracks student progress across cohorts  
- Generates real-time grading results  
- Provides performance analytics and reporting  
- Centralizes grading operations in a web-based interface  

All grading behavior is **configuration-driven**, allowing the system to adapt to new lectures and cohorts without changing core logic.

## Key Capabilities

- Automated repository evaluation via GitHub integration  
- Multi-cohort and multi-lecture support  
- Real-time grading results and status tracking  
- Centralized analytics and performance insights  
- Internal web dashboard for monitoring grading operations  
- Scalable architecture designed for growing student counts  

---

## High-Level Architecture

- Student repositories are sourced from GitHub  
- Grading rules are defined per lecture  
- A custom grading engine evaluates submissions  
- Results are stored and aggregated centrally  
- A web interface displays grading status and analytics  

This separation allows the system to remain flexible, maintainable, and scalable.

---

## Use Case

The system is intended for **internal use** in educational or training organizations where:

- Large numbers of student submissions must be evaluated  
- Consistent grading criteria are required  
- Real-time visibility into student progress is important

## Confidentiality Notice

This project was developed as an **internal system**.  
While the repository is publicly visible, production data, credentials, and organization-specific configurations are not included.
